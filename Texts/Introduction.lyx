No matter how far from the shore that you live, oceans still affect your
 life and the lives of your families and friends, classmates and colleagues.
 The air that you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat, the products
 that keep you warm, safe, informed, and entertained â€” all can come from
 or be transported by the ocean.

By keeping this statement above in mind, it is necessary to take a look
 at how to protect one of the most valuable environments of planet earth.
 One option is to use modern technology like robots to collect data in environme
nt monitoring missions to determine possible hazards.
 Robots of this kind already exist and many marine disciplines are using
 AUVs but for other reasons than monitoring.
 Robots like AUVs are commonly used in geoscientific missions mostly for
 profiling or filming the seafloor

 to take a video stream for the exploration of resources like poly metallic
 nodules and seafloor massive sulfides

.
 Many institutes like MARUM, DFKI, Jacobs University and some private institutes
 are working on automated systems for these underwater tasks and their simulatio
n.
 This thesis is working on an own way of interaction between an AUV and
 the environment.

The investigation of the seafloor and its habitats is mainly done by expensive
 explorations and will mostly be executed via ships.
 This means a lot of costs for universities and labor for the ships crew.
 The most expensive explorations take place in areas that can be hazardous
 for human beings and need a special trained crew.
 For keeping the risk at a low level, the dangerous areas are observed by
 Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).
 As useful as these systems are, they rarely can be found in less dangerous
 areas like shallow marine environments due to high costs but some projects
 tried to take first steps into that field because of their economic value.
 The shallow environments need to be observed because of different ecological
 reasons.
 The "Project Seagrass" provides first information about occurrence of seagrass
 in a scientific meaning which occurs in the area of green island near the
 Australian coast as well as near the coasts of Great Britain but in this
 work the area of Australia is of interest.
 Habitat monitoring is a field of growing interest but also stress analysis
 becomes more and more important also to the industries.
 This work will focus on combining the disciplines of marine geoscientific
 technologies of AUVs with the methods of artificial intelligence.
 The main point is to create an approach to improve the existing geoscientific
 methods of habitat monitoring by simulating an AUV that is able to scan
 an environment with optical sensors and to record the gained data in geoscienti
fic manner as well as in terms of artificial intelligence.
 While performing the mission, the entities given in teh environment are
 detected and stored in a hierarchically structure of semantic meaning.
 This enables to process the knowledge on the episodic memory (remembrance
 of a specific moment) of the robot to reason and understand its behavior.
 This makes it possible to reason for the robots findings and comprehend
 the robots behavior by extracting knowledge for humans.
